# Competitive Audits

A collection of my competitive audit submissions with detailed analysis and testing.

## Structure

Each audit contains:
- **Code annotations**: Look for `@audit` comments throughout the codebase for my reasoning and findings
- **Custom tests**: Located in `test/AuditTest` directory for each project

## Navigation
